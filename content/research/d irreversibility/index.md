Cellular structures constantly consume and dissipate energy on a variety of spatiotemporal scales in order to function. Their inherent multi-scale nature makes it challenging to unravel the mechanisms underlying the observed nonequilibrium activity. By analyzing probe particles embedded in the starfish oocyte cortex and using a multi-scale irreversibility metric, we extract model-independent estimates of the time-scales of energy dissipation. We further demonstrate that the irreversibility measure maintains a monotonic relationship with the underlying biological nonequilibrium activity. More generally, this irreversibility metric can be used to identify activity time scales in various biological systems.
