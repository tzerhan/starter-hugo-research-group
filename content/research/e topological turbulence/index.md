Starfish oocyte membrane exhibits Rho spiral wave dynamics when the GEF protein is over-expressed. Using phase and topological analysis, we showed that the membrane Rho spiral wave dynamics can be understood as interactions between topological defects in the phase field. These tools could be extended to the study of excitable spiral dynamics in neuronal systems and cardiac arrhythmia.  Recent studies have also revealed the importance of topological defects in collective multicellular behaviors, implying that topological aspects of biological systems could have functional importance.
