Our lab is interested in deciphering how order, symmetries and dynamics emerge in living matter. We are curiosity-driven. We make use of novel model systems and experimental techniques to explore organization principles in living systems at different scales. The lab currently focuses on two main directions: (i) we leverage on self-assembly of sea star embryo colonies to understand emergent chiral phenomena; and (ii) we build computational tools to understand mechanochemical principles of shape generation in multicellular systems. The lab is launching in 2023 Spring at UCSD Physics Department.
