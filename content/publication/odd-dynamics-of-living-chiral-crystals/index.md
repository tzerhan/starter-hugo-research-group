abstract: Active crystals are highly ordered structures that emerge from the
  self-organization of motile objects, and have been widely studied in synthetic
  and bacterial active matter. Whether persistent  crystalline order can
  emerge  in groups of autonomously developing multicellular organisms is
  currently unknown. Here we show that swimming starfish embryos spontaneously
  assemble into chiral crystals that span thousands of spinning organisms and
  persist for tens of hours. Combining experiments, theory and simulations, we
  demonstrate that the formation, dynamics and dissolution of these living
  crystals are controlled by the hydrodynamic properties and the natural
  development of embryos. Remarkably, living chiral crystals exhibit
  self-sustained chiral oscillations as well as various unconventional
  deformation response behaviours recently predicted for odd elastic materials.
  Our results provide direct experimental evidence for how non-reciprocal
  interactions between autonomous multicellular components may facilitate
  non-equilibrium phases of chiral active matter.
