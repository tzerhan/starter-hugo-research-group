(to fix) How does collective cell behavior give rise to chirality in multicellular systems?

<!--more-->

Collective cell dynamics play a crucial role in many developmental and physiological contexts. In this work, we use murine pancreas-derived organoids to study tissue rotation, a phenomenon widely reported both in vivo and in vitro. Using a 3D vertex model, we demonstrate how the interplay between traction force and polarity alignment can account for these distinct rotational dynamics. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the spherical tissue rotates as an active solid and exhibits spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. Using a continuum model, we demonstrate how the types and location of topological defects in the polarity field underlie this symmetry breaking process. Altogether, our work shows that tissue chirality can arise via topological defects in the pattern of cell traction forces, with potential implications for left-right symmetry breaking processes in morphogenetic events.
