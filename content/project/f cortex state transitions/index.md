The actomyosin cortex, consisting of filamentous actin, myosin molecular motors and various cross-linking proteins, is a thin layer of structure beneath the cell membrane that regulates cell shape. To understand how this multi-component system gives rise to emergent mechanical properties, we used a reconstituted system to study how cross-linker protein concentration modulates the structure and dynamics of actomyosin cortex. We discovered that as the amount of cross-linking is tuned, the system transitions from a free-flowing state with maximal susceptibility to a contractile state, suggesting that cross-linker concentration could be used to induce major structural reorganization in the actomyosin cortex and dynamically regulate cell mechanics.
