I am an ELBE postdoc at MPI-CBG (Dresden, Germany) working with Anne Grapin-Botton and Stephan Grill. During my PhD, I worked with Nikta Fakhri (MIT, USA) to study symmetry, topology and geometry of biological active matter.  After my PhD, I spent a few months at the Quantitative Biology Initiative (Harvard University, USA) as an independent fellow to study how cellular aggregates form tissues and how sea star embryos can self-assemble into active chiral crystal. My current research effort is focused on understanding formation of complex 3D tissue architecture using pancreas organoids as a model.
